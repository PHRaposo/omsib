# OMSIB LIBRARY

Export scores from OpenMusic to Avid Sibelius Software.

This is the beta release of the library.
By Paulo Raposo.

The majority of the code was adapted from Omlily library by Karim Haddad (IRCAM).

With OMSIB it is possible to export voice or poly objects as a text file (.txt) and read them in Avid Sibelius Software using an external plugin (included in the /resources/plugin/ folder of this repository).

PLUGIN INSTALLATION

 The entire plugin folder (OpenMusic to Sibelius) should be placed in the Sibelius plugins folder.

-> For Windows: C:\Users[My Username]\AppData\Roaming\Avid\Sibelius [Version]\Plugins
